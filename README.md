🌊 AI-Powered Conversational System for ARGO Float Data
📌 Background

Oceanographic data is vast, complex, and heterogeneous – ranging from satellite observations to in-situ measurements like CTD casts, Argo floats, and BGC sensors.
The Argo program, which deploys autonomous profiling floats across the world’s oceans, generates an extensive dataset in NetCDF format containing temperature, salinity, and other essential ocean variables.

Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data traditionally requires domain expertise, technical skills, and familiarity with specialized tools. With the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when integrated with structured databases and interactive dashboards, it has become feasible to build intuitive, accessible systems that democratize access to ocean data.

🎯 Project Description

This project develops an AI-powered conversational system for ARGO float data that enables users to query, explore, and visualize oceanographic information using natural language.

✅ System Capabilities

📂 Ingest ARGO NetCDF files and convert them into structured formats (SQL/Parquet).

🗂️ Store metadata & summaries in a vector database (FAISS/Chroma) for efficient retrieval.

🤖 Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by multimodal LLMs (GPT, QWEN, LLaMA, Mistral) to interpret natural language queries.

🔗 Leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting LLMs to databases.

📊 Interactive dashboards (Streamlit/Dash) for visualizing ARGO profiles:

Float trajectories

Depth-time plots

Profile comparisons

💬 Chatbot interface for natural language queries like:

“Show me salinity profiles near the equator in March 2023”

“Compare BGC parameters in the Arabian Sea for the last 6 months”

“What are the nearest ARGO floats to this location?”

This tool bridges the gap between domain experts, decision-makers, and raw data, making ocean insights accessible to non-technical users.

🛠️ Expected Solution

⚙️ End-to-end pipeline to process ARGO NetCDF data and store it in PostgreSQL + Vector DB (FAISS/Chroma).

🤖 LLM-powered backend to translate natural language → SQL queries → RAG-enhanced responses.

🌍 Frontend dashboards with geospatial visualizations (Plotly, Leaflet, Cesium).

💬 Chat interface for guided data discovery.
